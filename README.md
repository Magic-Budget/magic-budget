## Technologies

The application will use Spring Boot for the web backend and Next.js integrated with ShadCN and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The backend dependencies will be managed with Gradle, while NPM will handle dependencies for the frontend.

For continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), we will utilize GitHub Actions, and the entire application will be containerized using Docker. The database of choice is PostgreSQL, as its one of the most popular database management systems. Additionally, the REST API in the Spring Boot backend will be documented using Swagger, providing a clear and interactive API reference for developers.

For testing the application we will use Playwright to test the website frontend. JUnit and Mockito to handle testing the backend of the application. While also using Locust to load test the backend.
